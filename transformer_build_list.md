Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted a life-sized transformer. As I grew, I quickly learned how unrealistic it is. But as I am now at University with resources and people with experties I am finally able to see my childhood dream come true. Although it is still in very early production, this does not always mean trapped in "development hell"
